This code is designed to read analog voltage at pin A0 and convert it into curent value by using a 1W 1ohm resistor in series with the motor. Using a threshold value, the direction of motor can be reversed.

Components required:
1. Arduino UNO, NANO or Mega.
2. 1W 1ohm resistor.
3. 5V DC motor.
4. Motor Driver L298N.
5. 5V 500mA - 1A power supply.
6. Jumper Wires.
7. Breadboard.
